#### A word on donations…
*We hold strong on the belief that a community needs morals and values to stay together and have fun together. As such, the server does **NOT** accept payments, nor donations at the moment. Instead, you may donate to a pre-approved charity below and send us proof of (literal) donation, or let us verify the legitimacy of a different one by contacting an Admin on our Discord. From there, we will grant a reward of sorts. The server owners and staff will never aim to profit off of the server should the need arise for “donations,” and they will be just that—donations. :)*
